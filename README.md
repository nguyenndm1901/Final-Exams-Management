## Final Exams Management Project

### Description
- Final Exams Management is my first solo-project written by Java. This project is very easy to use, it takes only 5 minutes to get familiar.

### Functions
- Add, edit or delete a scheduled exam (included subject's code, subject's name, room, date, shift, number of candidates, number of examiner).
- Search for exam's information.
- Make a report of number of subjects, scheduled rooms, assigned examiners, which room has less candidates, which room has most candidates, how many exams have been carried on compare to a static date.
- Sort exam's information by subject's name. Make a report of number of scheduled room, number of candidates, number of assigned examiners of that subject.
- Refresh the result table.
